# Misc MTG Scripts
A collection of various scripts I've written to calculate fun trivia about Magic: The Gathering

## MTG YGO Names
A script that finds card names shared between both Magic: The Gathering and Yu-Gi-Oh!. Also contains some other scripts to do things with Yu-Gi-Oh! data while I had it.

## Enchant Worldle Entropy
A script that calculates the entropy for each potential first guess in a game of [Enchant Worldle](https://enchantworldle.com/). Inspired by 3Blue1Brown's [Wordle video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v68zYyaEmEA).
